Hi!
I'm dusting off the knowledge I gained from the Postgraduate degree in Business Intelligence & Analytics I graduated from 2 years ago.
Recently, I quit my Banking job so I can transition to Data Analytics.
Data cleaning doesn't scare me - in fact, I quite enjoy it :)
And my hobbies are tennis, karting and photography.
